# Comprehensive Day Overview: Ace Jernberg - March 2, 2025

## Morning Crisis Management: Peter's Police Situation

The day began with an unexpected situation when Ace woke up around 10:11 AM to discover several missed urgent messages from Peter (P.S.) sent at 7:01 AM stating "I'm in the police" with requests to call him. This immediately triggered concern, with Ace responding:

> "Yoyoyo i sleep early, what happend? ü´£ü´£ü´£ü´£" followed by "Police?!"

The situation prompted parallel conversations with Monika Adamin, who had been with Peter the previous night at a karaoke bar. Monika confirmed Peter had dropped her home around 7 AM, just before his concerning messages. Ace shared a screenshot of Peter's messages with Monika and inquired about what car Peter was driving. 

The situation was also discussed with Ahura Mazda (referred to as "Arash" by Ace), who had been with Peter and Monika at karaoke. Ahura reassured Ace: "He most be ok because I haven't heard anything."

By 12:29 PM, the situation was resolved, with Ace informing Monika: "He is home safe" - a message Monika confirmed she had also received directly from Peter. This crisis management scenario demonstrated Ace's network coordination, following up with multiple contacts to gather information about Peter's wellbeing.

## Business Operations: Car Transport Coordination

A significant portion of the day was dedicated to organizing a complex car transport operation from Murcia to Marbella. This involved coordinating multiple people to drive two cars (a Mercedes and an Audi) back to Marbella.

The planning began with messages to Daniel Mikael:
> "Can ni fixa en till snubbe? So vi f√•r ned 2 bilar? ü§ó"

This evolved into detailed logistics discussions with Daniel and Firas Radhi, with Ace sending location details for Murcia (approximately 4-5 hours away). The compensation arrangement was negotiated:
> "100 euro var? Rimligt?"

The conversation with Firas revealed challenges with the supplier, with Firas sharing frustrations about payment demands:
> "Money need to be on my account before I can let the car out."

This led to a heated exchange where Firas expressed his frustration through voice messages about the supplier's behavior. Ace provided strategic business advice:
> "Allts√• jag vet inte, det √§r fattiga horungar kanske, de ser att du b√∂rjar f√• ihop dig nu och d√• blir de s√• h√§r lack p√• att du ska g√∂ra business i Spanien nu, och det √§r deras st√§lle."

After securing drivers (Daniel and his friend Bobby), Ace also approached Luke as a potential third driver, initially offering to pay "half of the fine 400" in exchange for Luke's assistance. However, by early evening, the trip arrangements were modified, and Ace informed Luke: "Hey luke cancelled tomorrow."

## New Business Development: Drone Photography Prospect

A promising business lead came through 3SA Concierge Marbella, who connected Ace with Caroline Winters, a potential client seeking drone photography services for a high-end cosmetics shoot.

The initial inquiry came at 12:30 PM with Caroline explaining:
> "I'm looking for a drone photographer for a cosmetic shoot in Marbella"

Ace's approach demonstrated his business acumen, first asking about budget before diving into details. When Caroline pushed back on discussing budget first, Ace explained his rationale through a voice message:
> "...why I ask you about the budget is because then we can see instantly if we can work together or not because yeah we can do everything and we do everything in-house and if we have a whole marketing agency..."

Caroline responded with an extensive voice message detailing her project - a cosmetics campaign featuring locations across Marbella, with Ed Sheeran's video photographer flying in from the UK. She emphasized the prestige of the project:
> "We are creating history here and we need people on the team understanding that."

Ace navigated this high-value prospect skillfully, offering to send portfolio examples while also highlighting his capability:
> "Okey i will go to the office later today, and i will see what i can find, but we can do anything really, we have 8 diffrent drones ü§ó"

This exchange highlighted Ace's business development approach - qualifying leads, showcasing capabilities, and positioning his services appropriately for premium clients.

## Property Management & Personal Life

Conversations with Annette (in Swedish) revealed insights into Ace's living situation. Annette appeared surprised to learn they had already moved into what she referred to as "slottet" (the castle):

> **Annette**: "Va? üòÆ det har inte jag fattat ü§©"  
> **Ace**: "Vad menar du? Vi bor ju d√§r nu"

Ace shared a photo of himself with Casper in a convertible, mentioning they now have three BMW Z3s:
> "Casper fick ned sin z3 nyss ocks√•. S√• nu har vi 3 z3"

This was followed by a conversation about who was living at the property, with Annette asking if "alla ni d√§r nu ink killarna?" (all of you including the guys).

The property management aspect of Ace's day also included a brief interaction with David Ballard, who arranged to drop off a key at Ace's location around noon. 

## Professional Collaborations and Projects

Throughout the day, Ace engaged with several professional collaborations:

1. **AI Development with Velislav**: Velislav shared a Google Docs link, and later posted in the "3SA Rental AI Agency" group chat about gaining API access:
   > "I got the API access and I'm currently re-building the agent entirely so it can make full use of it. The possibilities now with this API are insane..."

2. **Logo Design Support**: In the "Mfinity - Content Currency" group chat, Velislav offered to help A.Ri.A with logo design for a luxury car rental business in Marbella.

3. **Car Maintenance with Kornelijus**: Discussing the reassembly of a car before it goes to Malaga for painting:

   > **Kornelijus**: "maybe tomorrow"  
   > **Ace**: "Its gonna go to malga for paint"

4. **Collaboration with Mantelo.Rentals**: A brief exchange regarding changing license plates on a Range Rover, with Ace confirming the task was "Delivered" and "She happy."

## Evening Arrangements

A final message to P.S. at 19:30 indicated some communication challenges:
> "Bad connection, diddi call dabi she explain and open"

## Weather Impact on Business Activities

Inclement weather affected planned business activities, as evidenced in the conversation with Jesus Morales, who had planned car photography with Ace. Jesus sent a photo showing better weather at his location, but Ace's response showed rain at his property:

> **Jesus**: "In my house is not bad üòÇ"  
> **Ace**: "Mine is bad"

Jesus acknowledged with "Skitv√§der" (shit weather), highlighting how external factors impacted the day's planned activities.
