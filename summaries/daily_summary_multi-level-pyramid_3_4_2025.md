The meeting included Johan Staël von Holstein (possibly an investor or advisor) and Erik Wikström, who subsequently shared a pitch deck template and committed to following up with Johan. This suggests the venture may be preparing for investment pitches or partnership discussions. The involvement of both Elias and Ace indicates collaborative leadership on this project.
