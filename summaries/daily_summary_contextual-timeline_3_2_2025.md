# A Day in the Life: Ace Jernberg's WhatsApp Chronicles (March 2, 2025)

## Morning: An Unexpected Crisis

**07:01 AM - Urgent Messages from Peter**  
While Ace slept, having had a late night, his friend Peter (P.S.) sent several alarming messages: "I'm in the police" followed by "Call me." These messages would set the tone for the early part of Ace's day, creating immediate concern when discovered hours later.

**10:11 AM - Waking to Worry**  
Ace woke to find Peter's concerning messages from three hours earlier. The timestamp gap reveals Ace's late night, likely connected to the previous evening's social activities that multiple contacts reference throughout the day. His immediate response showed confusion and concern: "What happened?!" followed by "Police?!"

**10:15 AM - Information Gathering**  
In a textbook example of crisis management, Ace immediately reached out to Monika Adamin, who had been with Peter the night before at a karaoke event. A parallel investigation began as Ace sent a screenshot of Peter's messages to Monika to establish a timeline.

> "He dropped me home at 7" - Monika Adamin

This critical piece of information established that whatever happened with Peter occurred shortly after dropping Monika offâ€”the first piece in reconstructing the night's events.

**10:26 AM - Expanding the Search**  
Ace contacted Arash (Ahura Mazda), another participant in the previous night's karaoke excursion, sending voice messages inquiring if he knew anything about Peter's situation or how to locate him. The search for information continued while Ace simultaneously had to address scheduled business matters.

## Mid-Morning: Business Continues Despite Uncertainty

**11:38 AM - Weather Forces Business Adjustment**  
Despite the ongoing concern about Peter, Ace's professional obligations continued. Jesus Morales contacted him about a planned car photoshoot, but the weather wasn't cooperating. Both shared photos of their respective locationsâ€”Ace's showing rain, Jesus's showing clearer conditionsâ€”leading to a postponement of their planned "bilbilder" (car pictures) session.

**11:43 AM - Coordinating a Key Handover**  
David Ballard contacted Ace about dropping off a key, requiring Ace to share his location and coordinate a quick meetup. By 12:02 PM, this handover was completed efficientlyâ€”a glimpse into Ace's property management responsibilities despite the morning's disruption.

**12:26 PM - Rental Business Operations**  
Mantas from Mantelo.Rentals reached out about a customer wanting to rent a Range Rover. Ace, still recovering from the previous night, explained they would be at the office around 1:30 PM. In an intriguing development, Mantas requested Ace swap license plates between vehicles (from Mantello to Yello)â€”revealing some of the behind-the-scenes operations of the rental business.

## Midday: Resolution and New Opportunities

**12:29 PM - Relief About Peter**  
The concerning situation with Peter resolved as Ace confirmed to Monika: "He is home safe." This resolution came just in time as Ace's day was becoming increasingly complex with business demands pulling him in multiple directions.

**12:30 PM - Unexpected Business Opportunity**  
As one crisis resolved, a significant opportunity emerged when Caroline Winters contacted Ace about drone photography services for a high-end cosmetics shoot. The introduction came through 3SA Concierge Marbella, showcasing how Ace's business network creates referral opportunities.

Caroline described an ambitious project:
> "We are having Ed Sheeran's video photographer getting flown in from the UK in order to make these video materials for the 10 days that we're shooting in Marbella."

This potential collaboration demonstrated the caliber of clients Ace's Content Currency business attracts. His response emphasized their capabilities while maintaining professionalism:
> "We have 8 different drones ðŸ¤—"

## Afternoon: Complex Logistics Planning

**2:17 PM - Vehicle Acquisition Planning**  
A significant portion of the afternoon involved intricate planning around car transportation. Ace coordinated with multiple contacts including Firas Radhi, Daniel Mikael, and potentially Luke to arrange for cars (a Mercedes and an Audi) to be picked up from Murcia and brought to Marbella.

The logistics were complex, revealing challenges in Ace's supply chain:
> "TÃ¤nker drar man efter 10 typ 10:30 sÃ¥ slipper man all trafik och Ã¤r dÃ¤r till 13" - Daniel Mikael
> (Thinking if we leave after 10 around 10:30 we avoid all traffic and are there by 13)

Further complications arose from tensions with a supplier named Pedro, whom Firas described as demanding advance payment and being difficult to work with:
> "JÃ¤vla kuksukare vet du. Fan jag Ã¤r inte hemma du vet, sÃ¥ jag har inte hunnit gÃ¶ra det. Det var fan en fÃ¶r jÃ¤vla hets assÃ¥, jag fattar inte vad fan det Ã¤r fel pÃ¥ mÃ¤nniskor."

This aspect of Ace's day highlighted the challenges of international business operations and supply chain management.

**2:19 PM - Task Completion**  
Ace confirmed to Mantas that the license plate swap task was completed and "She happy"â€”efficiently closing that operational loop while juggling multiple other concerns.

## Evening: Social Connections and Event Planning

**5:16 PM - Confirming Evening Plans**  
Ace confirmed a 19:30 meeting with P.S. (Peter has apparently recovered from his morning troubles), demonstrating how quickly the day's narrative shifted from crisis to normal operations.

**7:00 PM - Swedish Family Connections**  
A conversation in Swedish with Annette revealed details about a new property acquisition. Ace shared a photo of Casper in a BMW Z3, mentioning they now had three Z3s in their collection. References to Dani's brother and girlfriend visiting from Romania added context to Ace's personal life intersecting with business operations.

**7:30 PM - Technical Difficulties**  
As the evening progressed, Ace messaged Danis about connection problems, suggesting calling Dani for explanation and to "open" (likely referring to access to their meeting location). This suggests some complication with the 19:30 meeting arrangements.

**8:30 PM - Project Update in Group Chat**  
In a business group chat, Velislav shared an update about securing API access for an AI agent they were developing, which excited Benny from 3SA Estate Marbella. This glimpse into Content Currency's AI development work showed the technology side of Ace's business portfolio.

## Late Evening: Tomorrow's Possibilities

**8:46 PM - Enthusiasm for AI Development**  
Benny responded to Velislav's update with enthusiasm: "WooowðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°" and "Really looking forward to test itðŸ’ªðŸ’ª"â€”highlighting the anticipation around Content Currency's AI solutions.

**1:51 AM (Next Day) - Late Night Business Inquiry**  
The day extended into early morning hours with Monika reaching out at 1:51 AM asking if Ace knew of any villa with a pool and spa available for a one-day rental for Polish clients "who want to party." This last-minute request demonstrates how Ace's network views him as a go-to resource for luxury arrangements in Marbella, even at unusual hours.

## Key Business Operations Revealed

Throughout the day's conversations, Ace's business ecosystem became apparent:

1. **Content Currency** - His primary business focusing on luxury videography, AI solutions, and development services
2. **Vehicle Operations** - Acquiring, transporting, and possibly renting luxury vehicles
3. **Property Management** - References to a new villa acquisition and rental properties
4. **Drone Services** - Professional drone photography/videography for high-end clients
5. **AI Development** - Collaboration with Velislav on advanced AI solutions

## The Day's Emotional Arc

The day began with unexpected concern about Peter's police situation, creating immediate tension. This was gradually replaced by relief as Peter's safety was confirmed, allowing Ace to fully engage with business opportunities like the cosmetics shoot and vehicle logistics. 

The mid-day challenge with the supplier Pedro introduced conflict, while the evening brought more positive developments with technology updates and social connections. The day's narrative showed Ace's ability to navigate crises while maintaining business momentumâ€”a skill that appears central to his success in managing diverse business interests.

What began as a day of concern ended with forward-looking business discussions and planning, demonstrating Ace's resilience and ability to maintain perspective across personal and professional challenges in his dynamic business ecosystem.
