The price is $24.99, with delivery expected on Thursday, March 20. It ships to Spain and has only 4 left in stock, suitable for ages 12 and up.

        The image shows a view from high altitude looking down at Earth. The curvature of the Earth is visible, providing a wide view of the planet below, with a clear distinction between the atmosphere and space. The sky above is dark, transitioning to a lighter blue closer to the horizon. The Earth's surface shows a mix of land and cloud formations. Some large white clouds are visible towards the right side, while the rest of the surface appears mostly clear. In the foreground at the bottom of the image, part of a device or equipment is visible, which appears to be mounted to capture the view. At the top of the image, text reads: "The balloon has been a valiant steed but it is stretched to its limits." This suggests that the image could have been taken from a high-altitude balloon.

        The image is a text list detailing items acquired for a project involving a balloon launch. It is divided into two sections: 

1. Things procured on their own:
   - Styrofoam Cooler
   - Radar Reflector made from cardboard covered in aluminum foil
   - Parachute cord
   - GoPro camera
   - Mophie Battery Charger

2. Things purchased:
   - A balloon from Amazon costing $60, specifically a 600-gram weather balloon
   - Helium acquired by contacting local welding/gas suppliers and renting a 125 cubic foot tank for $80
   - GPS, which cost $200, and there's a note to discuss it more later
   - A 6-foot parachute costing $40; it‚Äôs described as potentially homemade but important for the project
   - Helium regulator/filling hose to safely transfer helium from a 2000 psi tank to the balloon, including a note about modifying the hose with a 1" attachment for easy filling. A helium regulator was purchased for $17 on Amazon. 

The text emphasizes activities and costs associated with preparing for the balloon launch.

        The image is divided into two sections. The top part contains text on a dark background, which reads: "My budget was significantly lower, partly because I had a GoPro already and hand made many other components. I estimate I spent about $400, of which the main costs were GPS and Helium." Below the text, there is an image of a large white spherical object, likely a balloon, positioned against a clear blue sky. The balloon takes up most of the lower portion of the image, and its surface appears smooth and well-defined.

        Ja, jag fick en request av Arman. Han jobbar ju deltid och filmar en flowershop h√§r i Marbella, ganska n√§ra tydligen till kontoret. Han m√•ste √•ka iv√§g till en urgent-lysa och fr√•gade om jag kunde ta √∂ver under en period p√• 2-3 veckor, filma 2-3 g√•nger i veckan, en halvtimme var. Med mobilen bara, inga edits utan lite shots bara helt enkelt. Och s√• skulle Arman redigera det. Och deras budget √§r 250 euro. Jag t√§nkte om jag skulle drabba √∂ver det med dig innan. Det √§r inte s√• mycket men inte s√• mycket tid allts√•. Vad tycker du?

Men oavsett g√∂r det d√• s√• tar vi dom pengarna och betalar s√• har vi bilen l√∂s direkt bara varje m√•nad. I sig att vi g√∂r det som en favour till han men ocks√• s√• betalar jag han 200 prutar jag ner det till f√∂r den d√§r sepungen liksom och det √§r fan inte bra heller. Men vad tycker du? Vad tycker du? Upp till dig vad tycker du?

        Ja, jag kan g√∂ra det. 2-3 g√•nger i veckan. Han s√§ger att det √§r bara lite mobilfilmning. Kanske p√• n√•gra blommor eller bilder med mobilen. Och s√• skulle han redigera det. Men det √§r sant, det √§r 250 euro. D√• betalar vi av en m√•nad p√• bilen. S√• det kan inte vara n√•got mer √§kta jobb. Jag ska fr√•ga honom lite mer.

        The image shows a garage setting with three cars parked in a row. The primary focus is on a blue BMW convertible with distinctive modifications. The car has golden-yellow alloy wheels, low-profile tires, and a lowered suspension, giving it a sporty, custom appearance. The front bumper appears to have some damage and lacks a front grille, exposing inner components. The headlights are partially disassembled or missing, and there's a sticker or tag on the windshield with characters on it.

To the left of the BMW, partially visible, is a red convertible, possibly another BMW model, with its soft top in place. On the right, slightly further back, is a black sedan parked at an angle, showcasing its front bumper and headlights.

The garage has a clean, polished concrete floor and high ceilings with an industrial look. There are structural columns and piping visible on the white ceiling and walls, indicating a spacious, warehouse-like environment with fluorescent overhead lighting.

        The image shows a blue BMW parked along a curb. This car has a sporty look with a distinctive body kit, including a front lip and flared wheel arches. Its windows are tinted, and it has large, five-spoke alloy rims. 

In the foreground, the car is positioned on a crosswalk next to a pedestrian sidewalk, which has a pattern of small square tiles. Streetlights extend skyward from the sidewalk, and there's a traffic yield sign nearby.

In the background, there's a row of beige, Mediterranean-style homes with decorative tiles on their roofs. The buildings are surrounded by a low wall with a small opening leading to a driveway where two other cars are parked. The scene is set under a cloudy sky, providing a slightly overcast light. The area around the road appears to be sparsely vegetated with some patches of grass or shrubs.

Monika responds at 16:08 with a message on a white background, acknowledging she just woke up from a siesta and is busy with work but assures not to worry. She mentions thinking about the other person and suggests finding time to meet soon.

A highlighted message is repeated, and Monika responds at 16:10, saying "Yes, perfect ‚ù§Ô∏è" to the previous message about spending time together in a few weeks.

        The image depicts an outdoor scene dominated by a partly cloudy sky. The clouds are dense and fluffy, with areas of blue sky visible. A power line runs diagonally across the upper part of the image.

In the lower portion, there is dense greenery, with various types of plants and trees. A prominent plant with purple flowers stands out in the center. To the left, there is a partially constructed building with scaffolding.

In the distance, there are more trees, and a tall metal lattice tower, likely a power transmission tower, is visible. The overall setting appears to be a suburban or rural area with a mix of natural and man-made elements.

        The image depicts an outdoor patio area with a natural and serene setting. The foreground features a wooden table surrounded by several wooden, slatted chairs, positioned on a patio with a brick or tiled surface. The ground is wet, suggesting recent rainfall or ongoing light rain. Above the seating area is a pergola with a canopy made of a grid of thin branches or reeds, providing partial shade and coverage.

In the middle distance, there's a low wall or barrier made of stone or concrete, which includes marble-like columns or supports. Just beyond this barrier is a swimming pool, whose blue water provides a contrast to the natural surroundings.

        The image shows a dark-colored sports car parked on an asphalt surface, specifically a Porsche with "Carrera" written on the back. The license plate reads "R210 PPE" with yellow background and black characters, suggesting a British-style plate. The car has a sleek, aerodynamic design with a rear spoiler integrated into the bodywork. Its large silver alloy wheels are prominently visible.

In the background, there's a silver sedan parked in front of the Porsche, identifiable by its distinctive taillights and rear design. Behind the sedan is a large white box trailer with double rear doors and metal hinges, parked against a building.

The building itself has a beige, textured facade with a dark-colored window and ventilation features. The scene is well-lit with natural sunlight, casting shadows from the vehicles and structures. A metal pole with a road sign, although unreadable, is visible near the sedan, and a red-bordered sidewalk edge is present at the bottom right corner of the image.

Reflections in the car's bodywork show a mix of clouds and sky, indicating the car is parked outdoors in possibly sunny weather. Additionally, part of another vehicle is visible in the background, showcasing a rearview mirror and part of the side, hinting at a parking lot or closely parked cars.

        The image is a screenshot of a WhatsApp chat with a dark-themed background featuring small outlines of various objects like cameras, trees, and smiley faces.

2. Below that message is a laughing emoji sent by the same contact, Elger.

3. The second graphic image appears to read "MARBELLA WORKSPACES." The text is highly abstracted, with various overlapping patterns, including bold and jagged white and black lines.

        So yesterday in the meeting with Luigi we decided that I was gonna look up another videographer for him and we could not take on that task because it's not cost-efficient and we don't feel that his budget is what it takes for us to be able to do a good job so I will now look for another videographer to do the high video quality and get that price as low as possible for us and then see if Casper can edit it really really quick and make profit from our first outsourced videographer that works for us on minor missions for small money

        The image shows the interior of a vehicle, focusing on the dashboard. In the foreground, there is a transparent bottle with a metallic cap placed in a cup holder. The bottle has an image of a muscular, shirtless male back printed on it. Beside the bottle, part of a garment, possibly a shirt or some fabric, is visible.

To the right, the vehicle's speedometer and dashboard are partially seen, showing a speedometer with markings up to 220 km/h. Some indicator lights are on, including a green one and one at the zero mark. 

Through the windshield, a building with a yellowish exterior and several windows with green frames is visible. Next to the building, there are blue road signs with white text, but they are only partially visible and not fully readable. The steering wheel is partially seen on the left, and the dashboard has a textured black surface.

        The image shows a blue BMW Z3 sports car parked indoors on a shiny light-colored floor. The car is a convertible with its top down. It has distinctive styling elements such as a wide, low profile and the signature kidney grille typical of BMWs. The front left headlight is missing, and the hood and front bumper show signs of wear or damage. The car is fitted with gold alloy wheels that contrast with the blue color of the body. Behind the BMW, there is a red Chevrolet Corvette with a beige interior, and next to it, partially visible, is a white car with red and gray accent stripes. In the background to the right, a dark-colored luxury sedan is parked, likely a Bentley, due to its grill design. The setting appears to be a spacious garage or showroom with white walls and large support columns. The ceiling has a grid-like structure with visible pipes and cables, contributing to the industrial feel of the space.

[3/7/2025, 7:25:13 PM] Ace Jernberg  (This imageMessage was converted to text)
        The image appears to be a screenshot of a mobile device screen displaying a confirmation message. At the top, there are indicators showing the time as 19:25, signal strength with four bars, a 4G connection, and a battery icon displaying a charge percentage of 41%.

In the center of the screen, there is a bold black check mark, indicating a successful action. Below the check mark, the text reads "Purchase made correctly" in bold, followed by a green horizontal line. 

Under the line, smaller text instructs the user to "Go back to the store's website to check your purchase." At the bottom of the screen, there is a blue button with the word "Ok," suggesting an action for the user to confirm the message and possibly close the screen. On the left side, there is a partial, gray, semi-circular icon with a white arrow, which seems to be for navigation.

        The image depicts the interior of a garage or showroom area, likely related to motorsports. The floor in the foreground is a metallic, diamond plate patterned surface. There are two tall, black stools with wooden seats visible, one partially shown on the right edge of the image.

In the background, the floor shifts to a smooth concrete finish that leads into a more open area where several vehicles are parked. These vehicles appear to be sports cars or racing cars, with visible elements such as spoilers and distinctive racing designs. A visible number "21" is marked on at least two of the vehicles, hinting at their potential use in competitive events.

Potted plants are placed near structural columns, providing some natural elements to the otherwise industrial setting. On the far wall, there is a large black banner with the name "MARBELLA MOTORSPORTS" in bold lettering. The area appears well-organized, suggesting it is a professional setting for car display or a motorsports business.

        The image appears to be taken from inside a vehicle at night. In the foreground, there is a part of the car's interior visible, including the dashboard and a digital display screen. The screen displays music details, showing an album cover at the left, and text indicating the song "PA PA" by an artist named Macky. The music is playing, shown by the play icon, and the timestamp at the top of the display reads 23:56.

Outside the vehicle, there is a view of a building entrance. This entrance is well-lit and features two illuminated columns. On either side of the entrance, there are decorative numbers "7" on the left and "3" on the right, possibly indicating an address. The entrance is framed by a white wall, with some greenery visible on the left side, covered by a dark mesh or netting. There is a diamond-shaped plaque or sign on the left wall. The door within the entrance is glass, with reflections and possibly some signage visible on it. 

The weather seems to be rainy or wet, as there are raindrops visible on the car windshield in the foreground. The entire scene is captured under low light conditions, typical of a nighttime setting.
