The screen is slightly tilted and up close, showing pixelation from the monitor. At the top, there is a green dot, likely indicating the user is online or active. Beneath this is a name, \"Daniel Olsrup\" and an ID number \"#DO19\".\n\nBelow the name, the account status is clearly shown in bold text: \"FREE MEMBER.\" There is also a note that this membership expires on \"10/03/2026.\" Underneath, the \"Current Balance\" is listed in green as \"50,00 C\", suggesting a balance of 50 units of some currency or credits, denoted by the letter \"C\". Next to this amount, there is a large green plus sign, likely a button for adding more credits.\n\nFurther down, a message in gray reads, \"Signed in for a few seconds (Since 00:08)\", indicating how long the user has been logged in. There is a warning in red with a triangular exclamation icon: \"Visit less than 15 minutes!\" possibly related to site usage limits or recommendations.\n\nAt the bottom of the image are some buttons and statistics. There is a \"Sign Out\" button, with a cursor icon hovering over it, and a green button next to it with an icon that looks like paper currency. There are also various small stats visible in gray, such as \"283 Total Orders\" and \"274 Visits\", with other numbers like \"0.03 C Avg Bar\" and \"50.00 C Last...\" partially visible.\n\nThe interface uses a clean, modern design with green, red, and black color highlights for important actions and information. The photo captures a zoomed-in section of the screen, cutting off portions of the context. \n[5/7/2025, 12:09:30 AM] B : L√∂ser f√∂r 50‚Ç¨\n[5/7/2025, 12:10:04 AM] Ace Blond : Yes üëå\n[5/7/2025, 12:10:32 AM] B  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        The image shows an electronic balance (digital scale) on a flat surface. The main focus is on the weighing platform, which has a transparent, square-shaped glass bowl placed on it. Inside the glass bowl are what appear to be some greenish-brown buds, possibly plant material. The scale has a large digital display that clearly reads ‚Äú3.74 g,‚Äù indicating the combined weight of the bowl and its contents in grams.\n\nThe balance is labeled \"ELECTRONIC BALANCE\" above the display screen. Around the display, there are seven buttons: \"BL\" (far left, mostly cut off), \"PRT,\" \"CAL,\" \"MODE,\" \"TARE,\" and a green button with no label near the top right of the display. The background shows part of a counter or table, with some small debris or particulates scattered nearby, likely related to the material being weighed. The colors in the environment include purple and other dim lighting, suggesting an indoor setting possibly under colored lights. The image is sharp and the scale's surface, along with the bowl and contents, are clean but with a few small scattered particles. \n[5/7/2025, 12:11:12 AM] B : Dejavu cocktail bar  √§r adresses\n[5/7/2025, 12:12:05 AM] B : En liten svart d√∂rr brevid den baren.

The monitor itself is shown in a dark indoor setting with a strip of purple and pink LED lights at the top of the image, reflecting on the monitor's surface. A white cable is also visible hanging down into the frame from the upper left corner.\n\nThe main and largest section on the screen shows an outdoor scene at night. This appears to be a street corner with a parking area. Detailed observations about this section include:\n- A paved sidewalk with a reddish and beige checkered pattern runs along the bottom and left edges.\n- Several parked cars are visible: a black car is parked by a yellow wall, a white car is parked behind it, another white commercial van in front, and a silver car parked at the far right.\n- The yellow wall separates the street level from a slightly elevated parking area above, where more cars can be seen, including a large black vehicle.\n- There is bright bluish-white light visible at the top center of the outdoor parking lot, probably from a streetlamp or a security light, shining through the trees in the background.\n- The surroundings are relatively quiet, with no visible pedestrians in the outdoor scene.\n- The curb is visible along the sidewalk, and an arrow painted on the road indicates a one-way direction.\n- The timestamp on the footage reads \"00:24:17\" and the date appears to be \"05-07-2025\".\n\nBelow the main section, there are four smaller camera feeds:\n- The bottom left feed appears to show a close-up of a dimly lit area, possibly an entrance, with a white shape (possibly an animal or an object) on the floor and a power socket on the wall.\n- The next feed to the right shows the interior of a bar or reception area, with a person sitting at a counter, multiple computer monitors, a laptop, and barstools. The scene is illuminated with purple-tinged lighting and various items on the counter.\n- The third small feed on the bottom right shows another interior view of the same or similar bar area, with tables and green upholstered chairs or stools arranged neatly.\n- The bottom right-most feed is yet another angle inside, possibly of patrons or staff sitting at a table.\n\nOverall, the image captures a comprehensive surveillance setup monitoring both indoor and outdoor areas, providing detailed coverage for security purposes. The lighting, arrangement, and environment all suggest a commercial setting, possibly a bar, club, or restaurant with parking facilities outside. \n[5/7/2025, 12:31:13 AM] B : Han b√∂r se denna parkering n√§r han √§r r√§tt\n[5/7/2025, 12:37:51 AM] B  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        This image appears to show a CCTV camera feed or a recording from a surveillance system. The photo is divided into sections by thin purple lines, indicating that this is likely part of a multi-camera surveillance display. \n\nIn the prominent middle section, there is a metallic or gray trash bin placed along the edge of a tiled area. The trash bin contains some garbage, which appears to include white material (possibly a plastic bag or paper) and a brown object that could be a bottle or can. The trash bin is placed next to a wall with vertical ridges or slats, possibly a security gate or a fence, and part of the area around the bin appears stained or dirty, probably from spillage or weather.\n\nThe ground is paved with square tiles, colored in alternating shades of off-white and tan, creating a checked pattern. A significant portion of the surface next to the trash bin is stained with a dark discoloration, suggesting water damage, mold, or spillage buildup over time.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, there is a digital timestamp in yellow numbers: \"07-05-2025 00:36.\" This indicates the date is July 5th, 2025, and the time is 00:36 (12:36 AM), which suggests the footage was taken late at night or early morning.\n\nAbove the main image, there is a partial view of another camera feed showing a different angle of a similarly tiled surface, but with little else visible in that frame.\n\nIn the bottom left corner, there are small sections of possibly another feed or interface, showing indistinct objects; one appears yellow and partially obscured, possibly a vehicle, and another are sections of white elements, which are too unclear to identify definitely.\n\nThe entire scene has the typical grainy and slightly pixelated quality of security camera footage. The colors are slightly distorted due to lighting and the nature of the surveillance recording. There also seems to be a bit of glare or reflection at the top left of the central image, possibly from a light source in the environment where the footage was recorded or from the monitor on which the image was taken. \n[5/7/2025, 12:38:13 AM] B : Liten svart d√∂rr. en plastback utanf√∂r √§r r√§tt\n\n\n--------------------------------\nChat Title: 46708948660@s.whatsapp.net (46708948660@s.whatsapp.net) - 07-05-2025\n\n\n---\nRelevant Context about the contact (THIS IS GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTACT, NOT THE CHAT - USE IT AS CONTEXT FOR THE PERSON BUT DON'T INCLUDE IT IN THE SUMMARY):\nCasper Lino Rosendahl is a Swedish-speaking video producer who works closely with Ace Jernberg at Content Currency on various video projects, including real estate videography and dental-related content.

There is a paved sidewalk in the foreground with large square tiles, some of which are white and the rest are reddish-brown. The sidewalk is next to a road where three cars are parked parallel to the curb, with a yellow painted curb and wall separating them from a higher parking lot area. The car closest to the corner is black, behind which a white car is parked quite closely. Another car, silver in color, is parked further along the yellow wall, partially near the end of the wall‚Äôs bend. Behind the yellow wall, there is a raised parking lot filled with several more vehicles, including SUVs, and the area is shaded by trees. A bright blue light, possibly a security lamp, is illuminating the scene, making large parts of the parking lot and street visible. An excavator arm is also visible in the upper left side, hinting at some construction or work nearby. Street markings, including two large white arrows, indicate the direction of traffic. There are also pedestrian railings, and a trash bin is visible along the sidewalk on the left.\n\nAt the bottom of the main feed, three smaller feeds are shown:\n1. The leftmost small feed shows an indistinct, dimly-lit indoor area, mostly obscured except for what appears to be a white shape (possibly a pet or small object) in the lower left corner. Some kind of power socket is visible on the wall.\n2. The middle small feed captures the interior of a bar or lounge with a counter topped with papers, computers, a laptop, and miscellaneous objects. There is a man sitting behind the counter, seemingly working, and several screen monitors and a gaming or vending machine can be seen. The lighting has a strong purple hue.\n3. The rightmost small feed offers another angle of the lounge or bar, showing a group of people seated together at a table, with more blue, green, and purple lighting. The lower half shows some bar stools and tables, and possibly a person standing by the edge near the counter.\n\nThe top right of the main feed has a timestamp, and the bottom of the whole monitor shows the SHARP brand name, suggesting the make of the screen. There is also a visible purple-pink strip of LED lighting above the monitor, and a white cable is hanging down from above, possibly for power or data. The upper background appears to be a wall or ceiling, reflecting the colored LED ambiance from the surroundings. \n[5/7/2025, 2:32:14 AM] Casper Lino Rosendahl : Yoyo s√§g till n√§r du √§r utanf√∂r\n[5/7/2025, 2:58:49 AM] Ace Blond : Nu\n\n\n--------------------------------\nChat Title: Content & Editing - Scandinaviansmiles (120363395479052486@g.us) - 07-05-2025\n\n\n---\nLast 10 Chat Messages Before Today:\n[5/3/2025, 3:05:13 PM] Tedi Trendafilovski (120363395479052486@g.us): we got hit yesterday 3 times\n[5/3/2025, 3:05:15 PM] Tedi Trendafilovski (120363395479052486@g.us): everything is down\n[5/3/2025, 3:05:16 PM] Tedi Trendafilovski (120363395479052486@g.us): ;/\n[5/3/2025, 3:09:41 PM] Velislav (120363395479052486@g.us): everything!?\n[5/3/2025, 3:09:56 PM] Tedi Trendafilovski (120363395479052486@g.us): On fb yes\n[5/4/2025, 4:00:04 AM] Casper Lino Rosendahl (120363395479052486@g.us): @38978619990 new 7 variations on sheets\n[5/5/2025, 7:03:36 PM] Casper Lino Rosendahl (120363395479052486@g.us): @38978619990 8 new variations up, coming some more and everything will be posted bit later\n[5/6/2025, 12:03:21 AM] Casper Lino Rosendahl (120363395479052486@g.us): @38978619990Bunch of videos uploaded + new editors\n[5/6/2025, 3:30:14 AM] Casper Lino Rosendahl (120363395479052486@g.us): @38978619990 1 new video uploaded to tiktok\n[5/6/2025, 10:14:48 PM] Casper Lino Rosendahl (120363395479052486@g.us): @38978619990 1 new video on tiktok\n---\nChat Messages From Today:\n[5/7/2025, 4:55:01 AM] Casper Lino Rosendahl (120363395479052486@g.us): @38978619990 2 more hook variations on sheets\n\n\n--------------------------------\nChat Title: 46707677141@s.whatsapp.net (46707677141@s.whatsapp.net) - 07-05-2025\n\n\n---\nLast 10 Chat Messages Before Today:\n[5/6/2025, 8:11:48 PM] Nicolina Engquist : Enjoyüòò\n[5/6/2025, 8:11:51 PM] Nicolina Engquist : Vart ska ni\n[5/6/2025, 8:12:05 PM] Ace Blond : Jag skippar med d√• ü§©\n[5/6/2025, 8:12:15 PM] Ace Blond : Tebaxs te kontoret ü§ò\n[5/6/2025, 8:12:29 PM] Ace Blond : Sleep taight babe! ü§ó\n[5/6/2025, 8:12:32 PM] Ace Blond : ‚ù§Ô∏è\n[5/6/2025, 8:19:17 PM] Nicolina Engquist : Tackü´∂üèΩ\n[5/6/2025, 8:19:23 PM] Nicolina Engquist : H√∂rs imorrnü©∑\n[5/6/2025, 10:06:02 PM] Ace Blond : Hoppas inte jag v√§cker dig , men jag k√∂pte dem h√§r till dig\n[5/6/2025, 10:06:10 PM] Ace Blond  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        The image shows a close-up display of three different car rims mounted on a black wall. \n\nAt the top edge of the image, there is a partial view of a bright pink rim with large openings, but only a part of it is visible and not its full design. \n\nJust below the pink rim, there is a rectangular sign featuring branding information. The sign reads \"LLANTASONLINE.ES\" with a blue digital-style font, and beneath that it says, \"N¬∫1 EN LLANTAS Y NEUM√ÅTICOS EN ESPA√ëA,\" indicating this is a business specializing in wheels and tires in Spain. The background of the sign includes a graphic of a car wheel.\n\nThe main focus of the image is a large silver alloy wheel positioned in the center. This rim features a multi-spoke design with 15 double spokes radiating out symmetrically from the center. The center cap of the wheel displays a distinctive logo with a 'T' shape enclosed in a shield or crest. The surface of the rim is clean and has a metallic finish, and there are multiple bolt holes surrounding the center.\n\nBelow the silver rim, there is a partially visible black and silver rim. This lower rim has a multi-spoke design as well, but the spokes are fewer, thicker, and are outlined in silver while the rest of the face is a glossy black. The center features a different logo, circular in shape, but the details are not completely visible because of the angle and lighting.\n\nAgainst the wall and between the silver and black rim runs a blue LED accent strip, casting a blue glow on the wall and parts of the rims, adding a modern, vibrant ambiance to the display. The wall itself is painted black with a textured surface, helping to highlight the rims on display. \n\nOverall, the image is part of a shop display likely targeted towards car enthusiasts or customers looking for custom wheels. \n---\nChat Messages From Today:\n[5/7/2025, 6:47:16 AM] Nicolina Engquist : Jag D√ñR\n[5/7/2025, 6:47:37 AM] Nicolina Engquist : √Ñlskar domüòç\n[5/7/2025, 6:48:58 AM] Nicolina Engquist : Du e galen\n[5/7/2025, 6:49:02 AM] Nicolina Engquist : Gillar de\n[5/7/2025, 5:15:05 PM] Nicolina Engquist  (This audioMessage was converted to text)\n        Jag √•ker till Stallet nu.

The foreground is dominated by a gravel or dirt path leading away from the viewer, with some light debris or dry grass scattered on it. To the left, there is a textured cement or concrete ramp that merges with the gravel path. \n\nOn both the left and right sides of the image, there are yellow-beige stone columns forming an entryway or gate, with a lower horizontal wall section visible on the left. Two potted plants flank either side of the entry pillars, each with greenery growing out.\n\nIn the middle distance, there is some loose material, possibly hay or mulch, piled up near the path further inside the property. Just beyond, a car is partially visible and parked to the right, next to a couple of white cylindrical tanks or large containers, which seem to be part of the infrastructure. Behind and above the car, tall bamboo or other dense shrubs grow, providing thick green foliage.\n\nMany tall palm trees, both near and in the distance, dominate the scene, with their thick, rough trunks and long, feathery, somewhat dry fronds swaying or clustered at the top. Power lines are strung high above, moving horizontally across the upper portion of the image, with a utility pole visible behind the leftmost palm.\n\nVegetation is lush and green, especially to the right and in the background, with the overall landscape revealing more palm trees, bushes, and what appears to be a grove or fields stretching out in the distance. The sky above is bright blue with a few wispy cirrus clouds, giving a sense of a sunny, warm, and dry day. The overall atmosphere suggests a tropical or subtropical climate, likely somewhere that supports both palm trees and agricultural activities. \n[5/7/2025, 5:54:57 PM] Ace Blond : √Ñr jag r√§tt ?\n[5/7/2025, 5:55:05 PM] Nicolina Engquist : Jaaa\n[5/7/2025, 5:55:07 PM] Nicolina Engquist : Kommer strax\n[5/7/2025, 5:55:16 PM] Ace Blond : üëå\n[5/7/2025, 11:41:43 PM] Ace Blond : Sov gott babe üòò\n[5/7/2025, 11:45:26 PM] Nicolina Engquist : Sov gott ü©∑\n\n\n--------------------------------\nChat Title: 34652029793@s.whatsapp.net (34652029793@s.whatsapp.net) - 07-05-2025\n\n\n---\nRelevant Context about the contact (THIS IS GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTACT, NOT THE CHAT - USE IT AS CONTEXT FOR THE PERSON BUT DON'T INCLUDE IT IN THE SUMMARY):\nCaroline Azzi is a professional contact of Ace Jernberg who has multiple projects to discuss with him.

The rack is white and made of metal rods, standing vertically with three cylindrical slots, each holding a large, blue-tinted transparent plastic water bottle. The bottles are stacked horizontally, one above the other, with their blue caps facing outward.\n\nThe rack is positioned next to a white wall with a mirror attached to it on the upper part. In the mirror‚Äôs reflection, you can partially see a man standing, wearing a light-colored short-sleeved polo shirt and dark pants. He is holding a smartphone in front of him, appearing to take the picture. The reflection also picks up some details from the environment, like a dark vehicle or possible car showroom in the background, horizontal and vertical beams, and other objects outside.\n\nThe floor is light-colored, possibly made of polished tiles, and there‚Äôs a black cable running along the corner where the floor meets the wall. The general setting appears to be indoors, and the water bottles are likely stored for use in an office, showroom, or waiting area. There‚Äôs a green bottle cap or a small disc-shaped object on the floor underneath the rack. The container in the background on the left side looks like a shipping container or a metallic partition. The image is well-lit with natural or artificial indoor lighting. \n[Media Caption] Empty\n[5/7/2025, 11:15:08 PM] Ace Blond : Hey elger, can i borrow the van to drive aome stuff away from the office to our apartment, we cleaned the office today ü§ó\n[5/7/2025, 11:52:27 PM] Elger Bouwman : Yes of course\n[5/7/2025, 11:52:38 PM] Ace Blond : Thanks!\n\n\n--------------------------------\nChat Title: 34692020649@s.whatsapp.net (34692020649@s.whatsapp.net) - 07-05-2025\n\n\n---\nRelevant Context about the contact (THIS IS GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTACT, NOT THE CHAT - USE IT AS CONTEXT FOR THE PERSON BUT DON'T INCLUDE IT IN THE SUMMARY):\nAnna –ú is a photographer who collaborates with Ace Jernberg to provide photography services for his clients.

All three photos show her from the chest up, smiling, and facing the camera directly. She is wearing a black top, and her hair is parted in the middle and hangs loosely around her shoulders. The background in each image is a light, neutral color.\n\nThe leftmost section is labeled \"Original.\" In this version, the girl's complexion looks natural, with visible blemishes, mild redness on her cheeks, and some uneven skin tone. The lighting appears soft and even, but the photo has a slightly duller and less enhanced look compared to the others.\n\nThe middle section is labeled \"Edited.\" In this photo, the girl's skin tone appears more even, and the redness on her cheeks is slightly reduced. Some minor imperfections seem softened, and the overall image looks slightly brighter and more vibrant, but some small blemishes or spots remain visible. The colors in her hair and skin appear subtly enhanced.\n\nThe rightmost section is labeled \"Retouched.\" Here, the girl's complexion looks smoother and more flawless, with no visible blemishes or redness. Her skin tone is consistent and even, with a soft, almost airbrushed effect. Her hair appears a bit more polished, and the color saturation and brightness of the image are slightly higher than in the previous two. The overall effect is a very polished, professional look, with every imperfection seemingly removed.\n\nThe three images are arranged side-by-side and show a progression from natural to heavily edited appearances, demonstrating the differences between \"original,\" \"edited,\" and \"retouched\" photograph styles. The labels for each image are written in white, rounded, sans-serif text at the bottom of each section. \n[5/7/2025, 10:06:55 AM] Anna –ú  (This documentMessage was converted to text)\n        undefined \n[5/7/2025, 10:06:55 AM] Anna –ú : *Original*\nThis is the unedited photo straight out of the camera.

The main focus is on a black car positioned in the center of the image. The car is notably dirty, covered in a thick layer of dust, and its front end is partially disassembled. The front bumper and grille are missing, exposing some of the internal parts and mechanical components. The car appears to be raised slightly off the ground, supported by a hydraulic floor jack placed underneath its front.\n\nBeneath the car, there are pieces of brown paper or similar material wrapped around the lower parts of the car, possibly to protect certain areas. The hood of the car remains closed but has noticeable dust and smudges on its surface.\n\nTo the left of the car, there is a red tool cart on wheels with several small items and tools on its shelves. Next to the cart, there is another car with its driver's door open and a door panel removed, suggesting it's also being worked on. Various equipment and car parts are visible in this area.\n\nThe background shows a workshop space with white and yellow-striped walls. Along the wall, electrical wiring and outlets are visible. There's a blue piece of equipment attached to the wall, likely for compressed air or an electrical device, with hoses or cords extending from it. Several black and yellow striped posts or markings are present, likely for safety.\n\nOn the right-hand side, there are more tools and materials, including what looks like rolls of material for wrapping or painting, and a yellow creeper (mechanic's lying board) is partially visible at the bottom right corner. The floor is a light gray color and looks dusty and worn from use.\n\nThe ceiling is metallic, with visible beams and fluorescent lighting, providing illumination for the workshop.

Their relationship combines business collaboration with personal support, as they work to overcome challenges with dishonest business associates in Spain. Firas is actively planning to relocate from Sweden to Spain in May 2025, while simultaneously growing his business in Sweden and preparing to take more direct control of their Spanish car rental operations.\n---\nLast 10 Chat Messages Before Today:\n[5/4/2025, 5:29:45 PM] Firas Radhi  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        The image shows a detailed outdoor scene with a blue sports car loaded onto a gray, multi-axle car trailer. The car has a sleek, aggressive design, low to the ground with large silver alloy wheels and low-profile tires, and a front license plate that reads \"HPW 940.\" The trailer itself is attached to another vehicle, part of which is just visible on the far left edge of the image‚Äîspecifically, the rear light and part of the bodywork, indicating that it is towing the trailer. There is also a spare tire mounted on the trailer near the hitch.\n\nThe setting is a gravel driveway surrounded by green vegetation and trees, some freshly leafed out. To the left of the car and trailer, there is dense shrubbery and the side of a light-colored house, partially in view, with a dark roof. In the background, there is a mix of tall trees, including a prominent slender birch tree to the right, and a smaller coniferous tree. An open green field stretches further back, indicating a rural or semi-rural location. The sky overhead is partly cloudy with patches of blue and sunlight breaking through, casting shadows and giving the scene a bright, natural look. The overall mood is peaceful and quiet, typical of a countryside residence or automotive location. \n[5/5/2025, 1:55:00 AM] Ace Blond  (This videoMessage was converted to text)\n        **Concise Summary:**\nThis video captures the exciting delivery and unloading of a diverse collection of high-performance and classic cars from a specialized multi-level transporter truck. Set on a sunny residential street with Mediterranean vibes, vehicles including Porsches (GT3 RS, 356 Speedster), a Ferrari F40, a classic Mini, a Pontiac Trans Am, and a Dallara Stradale are carefully moved from the truck and parked inside a sleek underground garage facility identified as \"The Bunker\".\n\n**Chronological Breakdown:**\n\n*   **(0:00 - 0:01):** An aerial shot shows a large, red and black multi-level car transporter (\"Aalborg Transport\") parked on a paved residential street lined with villas and greenery.

It then drives off the ramp onto the street.\n*   **(0:16 - 0:18):** High-angle shot tracking the F40 as it drives a short distance down the street and parks curbside near a modern building entrance with umbrellas.\n*   **(0:18 - 0:21):** Back at the transporter, the upper deck's ramp section is lowered, and the green Porsche 911 GT3 RS begins to drive down it.\n*   **(0:21 - 0:25):** Aerial shot tracks the green Porsche driving down the same street and parking behind the F40 near the building entrance.\n*   **(0:26 - 0:27):** The yellow classic Mini Cooper is manually pushed off the upper ramp by three men.\n*   **(0:27 - 0:31):** A black Pontiac Firebird Trans Am (late 70s model) with gold \"Screaming Chicken\" hood decal and gold snowflake wheels reverses off the lower level ramp.\n*   **(0:31 - 0:35):** People gather around the Trans Am, open its hood, and admire the engine.

In the foreground, there is a blue and white sport motorcycle parked on sandy ground behind a wooden fence. The motorcycle‚Äôs license plate reads 9987 FLV, and an EU symbol with the letter \"E\" (for Spain) indicates it‚Äôs from Spain. The bike has a sleek, modern design with a noticeable black windshield and rearview mirrors.\n\nTo the right side of the image, there is a large, old stone tower with a wide base and sloping sides. The tower appears to be historic, constructed from uneven stones and bricks. It has a small, arched window near the upper part, a rectangular doorway at ground level (covered with bars), and visible brickwork outlining its openings and corners. The stonework and architectural style suggest it might be a watchtower or defensive structure from an earlier era, typical of Mediterranean coastlines.\n\nBetween the motorcycle and the tower, a sandy path is dotted with small rocks and patches of grass. In the background, the fencing continues, enclosing a small picnic table and bench facing the sea, implying this spot is frequented by visitors. On the far left edge, part of a person can be seen, mostly out of the frame, wearing minimal beach clothing‚Äîindicating this is a warm-weather location.\n\nBehind the tower and stretching further right are a few palm trees and some additional structures or walls partially visible among greenery, reinforcing the coastal, possibly Mediterranean, setting. The overall mood is relaxed and sunny, capturing a mix of natural beauty, recreational elements, and historical architecture by the seaside.\n \n[5/6/2025, 3:59:28 PM] Kornelijus : best thing ever üëåüòÄ\n[5/6/2025, 3:59:37 PM] Ace Blond : Yes bro üôè\n[5/6/2025, 10:00:11 PM] Ace Blond : You okey?\n[5/6/2025, 10:03:06 PM] Kornelijus : yes yes is garage open\n[5/6/2025, 10:03:18 PM] Ace Blond : Yes we have a party\n[5/6/2025, 10:03:19 PM] Ace Blond : Come\n[5/6/2025, 10:03:22 PM] Ace Blond : üöÄüöÄ\n[5/6/2025, 10:03:22 PM] Kornelijus : i bring bike\n---\nChat Messages From Today:\n[5/7/2025, 12:39:45 PM] Ace Blond : Hey\n[5/7/2025, 12:39:57 PM] Ace Blond  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        The image shows a car‚Äîspecifically a dark-colored sports car‚Äîinside an automotive workshop or garage. The front of the car appears to be undergoing repair or assembly. The front bumper and grille of the car are missing, exposing internal components such as structural elements and possibly part of the cooling system. The headlights are present but the left headlight (on the image‚Äôs right) is not fully fitted, and some elements of the lower front fascia are also missing or detached.\n\nThe car is noticeably dirty, covered in a thick layer of dust, especially on the hood and windshield. There is a sheet of paper with what appears to be printed diagrams or text placed on top of the dusty hood. The windshield wipers also have visible dust on them. The car‚Äôs wheels are visible and the tires appear to be intact.\n\nTo the side of the car, there is a man‚Äîdressed in a black shirt‚Äîleaning into the driver‚Äôs side through the open door, possibly inspecting the interior or working on the car. Behind the car, there are workbenches with various tools and equipment, including a power strip, tool boards with hanging tools, and a spool of blue cable mounted on the wall. There are also several cardboard boxes around the vehicle, one of which is partially visible and open, suggesting parts may have been recently delivered or unpacked for the repair work.\n\nThe floor is a light grey color and looks like concrete, showing signs of wear and stains typical of a workshop. Yellow and black hazard striped tape is visible on a pillar in the background, which serves as a cautionary marker. The atmosphere and setup clearly indicate a car repair or customization shop, and the state of the car suggests it is mid-way through significant front-end repair or modification. \n[5/7/2025, 12:40:13 PM] Ace Blond : Can you check diagram asap?

Each part is illustrated separately, and most are labeled with unique numbers for identification, which typically correspond to a parts list (not provided here).\n\nStarting from the main or most central part, the image shows the main bumper cover (labeled as 1), which curves and forms the outer visible face of the car‚Äôs front end. This bumper cover connects to many smaller parts, brackets, and supports.\n\nAbove and to the right, there are two large reinforcement bars or absorbers (labeled as 10 and 11), which are structural parts mounted behind the bumper cover to absorb impacts. Below and slightly left, there are additional large components like inner reinforcements or covers (labeled 17 and 14).\n\nMany connecting parts are present such as brackets, clips, screws, and bolts (numbers 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, and 26). These are used for mounting and securing the bumper and other pieces to the car's frame or body.\n\nThe diagram also includes smaller plastic grilles or trims (for example, the pieces labeled 8 and 15), which usually fit into or alongside the main bumper cover. Other parts like the fog lamp housing or bezels (item 13) and sensors or sensor covers (item 22) are also shown.\n\nSome parts are drawn in detail with arrows or lines indicating their attachment points or relationships to the main bumper cover.\n\nOverall, this diagram is a comprehensive reference for the front bumper assembly of a specific vehicle model, showing the relationship and positioning of all individual components required for assembly or repair. \n[5/7/2025, 1:37:16 PM] Kornelijus  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        This image shows the underside of a vehicle, specifically the area near the front bumper and radiator. The perspective is from beneath the car, looking upwards. Several automotive components and structural elements are visible:\n\n- In the center and slightly to the right, there is a metal support bracket with a black rectangular plastic connector attached to it, suggesting it is part of a mounting system for the radiator or possibly a condenser for the air conditioning.\n- Behind the bracket runs a black flexible corrugated wire conduit, which is used to protect electrical wiring.\n- At the top right corner, a thick black rubber hose marked \"RAD\" is visible, which is likely a radiator hose responsible for carrying coolant to or from the radiator.\n- The left section of the image displays portions of the plastic undertray or splash guard, which protects the underside of the engine compartment from dirt and debris. Various clips and fasteners securing this tray can also be seen.\n- To the bottom left, the edge of the car's bumper and grille is partially visible, as well as a honeycomb-patterned grille opening.\n- Several metal and plastic vehicle subframe and chassis members are visible, painted black and showing some wear and dust.\n- The lighting suggests the photo was taken in a well-lit garage, possibly during a maintenance activity like radiator or undercarriage inspection.\n- In the lower left, text is embedded in the image, indicating the copyright belonging to \"HappyWrenching.com\" in 2014.\n\nThe overall setting and angle are consistent with a vehicle raised on a lift or ramps, with the photographer capturing details for instructional or documentation purposes. The visible hardware, connectors, and wiring loom all indicate this view is focused on the cooling and front-end support structure of the automobile. \n[5/7/2025, 1:37:20 PM] Kornelijus  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        The image appears to show the underside of a vehicle, specifically the front right section as viewed from below while the car is elevated, likely on a lift. Here are the detailed components and features visible in the image:\n\n1. **Plastic Undertray/Cover**: Most of the bottom part of the car is covered with a black plastic undertray or splash guard. This protects engine components from debris and moisture.\n   \n2. **Suspension Components**: On the right side of the image, visible are parts of the front suspension system, including the lower control arm, the CV axle (drive shaft), and the steering rack. The CV axle has a rubber boot which is ribbed, and is attached to the transmission and the wheel hub.\n   \n3. **Coolant Reservoir or Catch Can**: In the lower left center, there is a blue plastic container mounted underneath. This appears to be a coolant reservoir or some form of catch can, attached with a metallic bracket and visible hoses leading to and from it.\n   \n4. **Electric Wiring & Hoses**: Several wires and hoses are routed and secured along the undercarriage with clips and zip ties. These carry utilities to various automotive components (lighting, sensors, power steering, etc.).\n   \n5. **Radiator Support & Bracing**: Two shiny metal tubes run horizontally, likely supporting the front bumper or forming part of the structural bracing.\n   \n6. **Front Bumper and Wheel Well Liner**: The inside of the front bumper and the wheel well liner are visible, showing mounting holes and the fitment of the fender liner to the rest of the undercarriage.\n   \n7. **Tire and Wheel**: At the center-right, the tread and sidewall of the front tire are visible, indicating the car's wheel orientation.\n   \n8. **Protective Shields & Aerodynamic Panels**: Further toward the back, more plastic shields and panels are visible, serving to optimize airflow and protect additional underbody components.\n   \n9. **Garage Environment**: In the background on the left side of the image, garage items such as a silver ladder leaning against a white wall, a shelf with a yellow towel, and some bottles and a tool case are visible.\n\n10. **Copyright Notice**: At the lower left of the image, there is a watermark that reads \"Copyright 2014 HappyWrenching.com,\" indicating the image‚Äôs origin and copyright protection.\n\nOverall, the image gives a good view of the underside of a vehicle‚Äôs engine bay, suspension components, and protective underbody panels, as might be seen during a repair or inspection process in a workshop or garage setting. \n[5/7/2025, 1:44:03 PM] Kornelijus  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        This image shows the front section of a red car with the hood open. The vehicle appears to be undergoing some form of inspection or repair. The engine bay is partially visible, revealing various engine components. \n\nThe upper part of the engine bay is dirty, with visible dust and grime on components such as the engine cover and coolant reservoir. A prominent air filter with a cone shape and ribbed exterior is mounted on the right side (from the viewer's perspective), attached to aftermarket piping, indicating a non-stock air intake modification. \n\nNear the front, some of the structural frame and radiator support are exposed. The radiator, partially visible through an empty space where the front grille would typically be, looks dusty and possibly bent or damaged. The hood latch is visible and appears to be intact but surrounded by chipped and scratched paint, indicating rough handling or previous work. \n\nThe left (passenger) headlight assembly is missing entirely, exposing wires and mounting areas, while the right (driver's) side headlight is present but seems to be misaligned or partially detached. There is a hand in the right foreground, with an outstretched finger pointing towards the headlight area, possibly indicating or explaining an issue or damage.\n\nThere are also tools resting on the fender near the windshield, including what appears to be a red-handled screwdriver or wrench, suggesting that the vehicle is being worked on. The paint on the car's body shows some dullness and wear, and the car is parked on an old, weathered concrete surface with yellow lines, possibly in a parking lot. The overall scene strongly suggests that this car is undergoing repair, likely related to front-end damage or a modification project. \n[5/7/2025, 1:48:42 PM] Kornelijus : yes there is gap here üòÄ\n[5/7/2025, 2:15:55 PM] Ace Blond : Thats crazy\n\n\n--------------------------------\nChat Title: 34600007014@s.whatsapp.net (34600007014@s.whatsapp.net) - 07-05-2025\n\n\n---\nLast 10 Chat Messages Before Today:\n[5/6/2025, 5:22:43 PM] Ace Blond : Hello - Ace here\n[5/6/2025, 5:27:23 PM] DGB : Welcome to *ANDY‚ÄôS  EAT GREEK*,Marbella Please let us know how we can help you‚Ä¶\n[5/6/2025, 5:53:16 PM] DGB : Tomorrow  around \n12-1pm ?

The flowers appear fresh, with clearly visible petals, yellow-tipped stamens, and droplets of water on the petals, suggesting recent watering or rain.\n\nBehind the flowers, there is a modern indoor living space. The transition from outside to inside is marked by a set of tall, blue-grey curtains that are partly drawn to one side. The floor inside is made of light-colored tiles, possibly marble or a polished stone, adding a clean and shiny appearance.\n\nThe left side of the room features a countertop or bar area with two high bar stools in a light blue color. On the counter, there are a couple of glass bottles, a mug, and miscellaneous small items, indicating casual everyday use.\n\nIn the background, to the right, there is a beige or light brown sectional sofa with a single beige or white pillow placed on one end. The sofa sits next to a wall that is adorned with a framed painting or picture predominantly displaying shades of green, possibly depicting foliage or plants, adding to the indoor greenery theme.\n\nFurther in the back, there is a hallway receding into the distance, with light coming in from what seems to be an exit or window at the far end of the hallway. The ceiling above is smooth and white, fitted with small recessed lights.\n\nTo the right near the sofa, there appears to be a piece of furniture with blue sides and dark legs, possibly a pool table, adding a recreational touch to the home‚Äôs interior.\n\nOverall, the space is modern, fresh, and open, seamlessly blending the vibrant exterior flora with a clean and stylish interior. \n[5/7/2025, 12:55:29 PM] DGB  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        This image shows the interior of a modern, open-concept living space that combines elements of a kitchen, dining, and living room area.

The bar surface is made of wood, and it is supported by a blue-finished structure. On top of the bar counter, there are various items including a glass or tumbler, what looks like a bottle with a brown liquid (possibly a drink), a black electric kettle or coffee maker, a small white kitchen appliance (possibly a toaster), a metallic cup, and some cables or charging cords.\n\nBehind the bar, a patterned tile backsplash adds a decorative element to the kitchen area, which features a modern stainless steel cooker hood above. Below the counter to the left, there is a basket, likely for storage or perhaps recycling.\n\nThe right side of the image features an open living area with an L-shaped beige sectional sofa with a light-colored throw or pillow placed on it. A pool or billiards table, partly visible and edged with blue-colored felt, is in the foreground at the right edge, suggesting the room is designed for both comfort and entertainment.\n\nThe floor is finished with polished, light cream or beige tiles that reflect some of the natural light entering the room. Farther into the room is a hallway or corridor leading deeper into the home. At the end of this corridor, daylight illuminates a doorway or window space.\n\nThe walls are painted white, contributing to the open and airy feel of the space. On the right wall, there is a green-themed painting or artwork. To the far left, heavy light gray or silver curtains hang down, partially concealing the window or doorway they cover. The ceiling is plain white with multiple small recessed ceiling lights visible, providing even illumination.\n\nOverall, the room feels modern, well-maintained, and is set up for both relaxation and practical daily use, with zones for dining, lounging, and recreation all in one open space. \n[5/7/2025, 12:55:29 PM] DGB  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        The image shows a modern and neatly organized bathroom sink area. The background features large, light grey or white marble-patterned tiles covering the walls, providing a clean and elegant look. Mounted above the sink is a large, rectangular mirror that spans most of the width of the sink area, reflecting part of the room behind the photographer. The mirror is frameless and has four visible mounting brackets at the top.\n\nBeneath the mirror is a sleek, rectangular white sink that integrates seamlessly with a modern countertop. The sink has clean, sharp lines and a minimalist design. Sitting on the left side of the sink countertop are two items: a rolled-up blue towel and a rectangular yellow soap bar or soap dispenser. There is also a white wall power outlet visible on the backsplash, just above the countertop on the left side.\n\nThe sink faucet is silver, with a modern cubic design, and positioned centrally on the countertop behind the sink basin. To the right of the faucet and slightly concealed by shadow, there appears to be a clear container or dispenser, possibly for liquid soap or lotion.\n\nBelow the sink, the plumbing is exposed and made of shiny metallic material. On the wide, grey shelf underneath the sink, there are two large blue towels neatly rolled up and placed side by side, with a small gap between them. The shelf is supported by a light taupe or beige-colored vanity unit, which includes a large pull-out drawer; the drawer is slightly ajar, suggesting storage space for additional bathroom items.\n\nTo the right edge of the image, part of a white ceramic bidet (or toilet) is visible, indicating that this is part of a full bathroom facility. The overall lighting appears soft, with daylight possibly coming from an unseen window, as indicated by the subtle blue tinge and the reflection in the mirror. The space is meticulously tidy and gives off a modern, fresh, and welcoming atmosphere. \n[5/7/2025, 12:55:30 PM] DGB  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        The image depicts a tidy, modern bedroom with two single beds neatly arranged side by side. Each bed is made up with dark blue bed sheets, matching pillowcases, and a single, prominent bright red square throw pillow placed near the head of each bed, adding a striking contrast to the overall color scheme. On the bed closest to the camera, there are two blue bath towels carefully rolled and placed at the foot of the bed, while the second bed also has a similar blue towel rolled up at its foot. \n\nThe walls are painted white, contributing to a clean and airy ambiance, while the large built-in wardrobe at the far end of the room is finished in a matte dark gray color, with multiple doors and small round handles, providing ample storage space. \n\nOn the left wall, positioned above and between the two beds, is a single wall-mounted light fixture. The light fixture has a small lampshade and features brass or gold-toned detailing with a classic design, casting a soft, warm glow and creating a gentle shadow on the wall behind it. Ceiling-mounted spotlights in the corner further illuminate the room with bright, neutral light.\n\nOverall, the room appears minimalist yet cozy, defined by its simple color palette of blue, red, white, and gray, with careful attention to neatness and a sense of organization.\n \n[5/7/2025, 12:55:30 PM] DGB  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        This image shows part of the interior of a modern home. The perspective is from an open area that encompasses both a kitchen and part of a living space, looking toward a long, straight hallway.\n\nOn the left side of the image is a modern kitchen setup with glossy teal cabinets and drawers featuring sleek, long metallic handles. A wooden countertop runs along the edge, with a built-in stainless steel sink visible. Above the countertop, part of a wall with white diamond-patterned tiles is visible. There is an integrated black microwave in one of the tall cabinets.\n\nTo the right, there is a beige sofa with a large cushion and a smaller decorative pillow visible. The sofa faces away from the kitchen, suggesting this area is a living room or lounge space. A piece of wall art‚Äîa painting or print featuring large green leaves and a few visible brown stems‚Äîhangs just above the sofa on the white wall.\n\nThe floors are shiny, light-colored stone or marble tiles with natural veining, contributing to the overall bright and clean atmosphere. The ceiling is smooth and white, with several recessed spotlights spaced evenly along the ceiling.\n\nAt the center of the image, directly ahead, is a long hallway painted in white that draws the eye toward the back of the house. At the far end of the hallway, there is an open door or large window that reveals some greenery outside and allows natural light to flood in. In the doorway, there is a figure of a person standing, appearing to be wearing a long dress or robe, with their silhouette illuminated by the light from outside. The clear lines and modern design aesthetic make the space feel open and airy. \n[5/7/2025, 12:55:30 PM] DGB  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        This image depicts a modern outdoor space that appears to be part of a private residence, possibly a backyard or garden area. The ground is covered with neatly maintained artificial grass, giving a clean and vibrant green look to the area. In the foreground, there are pieces of white wicker outdoor furniture, including two rectangular lounge chairs or storage benches with their tops open and propped up, and two matching small square tables or footstools. The internal structure of the open benches is visible, showing their hinges and support bars.\n\nIn the background, along a light beige or cream-colored stucco wall, there is a large whirlpool hot tub or jacuzzi. The hot tub cover is partially open, revealing the clean interior of the tub. To the right of the hot tub, attached to the wall, is a sleek outdoor shower with a tall wooden or wood-paneled backing. The shower head extends from the top, with a separated control and a small hose, all made from metal, likely stainless steel.\n\nOn the far right, there is vibrant bougainvillea in full bloom, covered in bright magenta or purple flowers and green foliage, growing against the wall. Next to it is a medium-sized olive tree, its leaves a silvery green. Behind the jacuzzi, the wall is glass, likely a sliding door or window reflecting the garden scene, with the room interior slightly visible.\n\nOverall, the space is bathed in direct sunlight, casting crisp shadows across the artificial grass. The entire setup looks clean, modern, and designed for relaxation, with a touch of elegance brought by the plants and minimalist aesthetic. \n[5/7/2025, 12:55:30 PM] DGB  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        This image shows a modern, elegant bathroom with a minimalist design. The walls are covered in large, light-colored marble tiles with subtle grey and beige veining, giving the space a luxurious and clean feel. The floor also appears to be tiled in a light color that complements the walls.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a white countertop with an integrated sink that blends seamlessly into the surface. Sitting on the countertop are two items: a neatly folded blue towel and an amber-colored glass cup, which appears to be either a tumbler or possibly a toothbrush holder. Below the countertop is a shelf that holds two more rolled-up blue towels, adding a touch of vibrant color to the overall neutral palette of the bathroom. Also on the lower shelf to the left is a small, glass container, possibly a decorative jar or soap dish.\n\nTo the right of the sink area, there are two wall-mounted sanitary fixtures: a bidet and a toilet. Both have a sleek, rounded design and are mounted directly on the tiled wall, creating a floating appearance that contributes to the modern, clutter-free look. The bidet has a chrome faucet while the toilet has a push-button flush plate installed on the wall above it, which is also a modern touch. Both units are white and appear spotlessly clean.\n\nAbove the sink is a large wall-mounted mirror reflecting part of the ceiling and the shower area, although only a small section of the showerhead is visible in the reflection. The reflection also captures some recessed ceiling lights, which provide soft, even illumination in the room. The lighting in the bathroom is bright and natural-looking, highlighting the clean surfaces and modern fixtures.\n\nTo summarize, the bathroom is characterized by its use of white and marble, touches of blue from the towels, and ordinated, contemporary fixtures‚Äîcreating a visually appealing, fresh, and luxurious space. \n[5/7/2025, 12:55:30 PM] DGB  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        The image shows a sunlit outdoor garden area. On the right side, there is a large vibrant bush covered with numerous magenta or purple flowers, typical of a bougainvillea plant. The dense flowers dominate much of the right half of the image, with some green leaves visible among the blossoms, and the branches and trunk are visible at the lower part of the bush.\n\nThe bush is planted in a rectangular, raised garden bed with wooden edging. The soil in the bed appears dry and there are some irrigation tubes running through it, indicating an automated watering system for the plants.\n\nOn the left side and bottom of the image, there is a patch of artificial green grass, evident from its texture and uniform color. Adjacent to the garden bed is a small paved area made up of large, light-colored tiles.\n\nIn the background, there is a cream-colored building wall with some architectural elements visible, such as a corner of the building, a protruding section, and an awning or roller shade. Mounted on the wall is a metallic-colored outdoor light fixture. Beside the building, to the left, there is a partially visible hot tub or jacuzzi with a ribbed exterior cover and control panel, indicating a leisure or relaxation feature in this backyard or patio space.\n\nSome branches of another leafy plant or tree stretch into the upper left corner of the image, casting mild shadows and emphasizing the sunny weather. The overall scene looks clean, well-maintained, and inviting, suitable for lounging or enjoying outdoor time. \n[5/7/2025, 12:55:30 PM] DGB  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        This image depicts a luxurious outdoor swimming pool set in front of an elegant, multi-story building that appears to be a hotel or resort. The pool water is clear and blue, with metallic handrails on the right side serving as an entry point. The pool is framed by a white border which contrasts with the bright blue water. Around the pool, there are several lounge chairs and guests relaxing, while some areas have beige umbrellas providing shade. Meticulously manicured bushes and small trees surround the pool area, and several taller palm trees rise in the background, suggesting a warm, possibly Mediterranean or tropical climate. The sky is clear and vivid blue, indicating a sunny day with no clouds. The building itself is painted white with tan accents and features arched windows and balconies, some with decorative railings, enhancing the luxurious and inviting ambiance of the scene.

The focal point is a wall-mounted flat-screen television displaying a soccer (football) match. The game, which appears to be in full swing, shows players in front of a goal, and the action is dynamic with the ball near the goal area.\n\nBeneath the TV is a seating area with a white cushioned bench running along the wall. There is a single white, slightly wrinkled throw pillow placed on the bench, giving a comfortable and inviting feel. The walls have a modern, geometric design with yellow panels and strip lighting that glows orange-red, enhancing the contemporary and cozy vibe.\n\nIn the foreground, a glass table reflects the lighting and has several items on it. Closest to the camera on the right, there is a tall, ornate hookah (shisha) setup with a metal stem and a black mouthpiece. Near the center, an opaque blue bottle with a black cap‚Äîpossibly a water bottle or container‚Äîsits on the table with its cap removed nearby. Two black objects that look like bracelets, smart bands, or accessories rest just behind the bottle cap.\n\nTo the left, a man with short black hair, a trimmed beard, and a light skin tone is seated at the table. He appears to be engrossed, either eating or preparing something from a plate in front of him. There is a glass, partially filled with a straw, and a small, opened green can‚Äîlikely a beverage like Sprite or 7UP‚Äînext to him on the table.\n\nThe overall environment gives off a relaxed, social vibe with hints of nightlife or casual evening enjoyment. The ceiling has a smooth, slightly curved finish with recessed fixtures, complementing the room's cozy yet stylish appearance. The combination of soft seating, casual dining, and the hookah suggests this is a place where people come to unwind, enjoy food and drinks, watch sports, and perhaps socialize or smoke shisha. \n[5/6/2025, 10:45:12 PM] Ace Blond (120363418340291229@g.us): Afendi üëåüëåüëå\n[5/6/2025, 10:45:21 PM] Javid (120363418340291229@g.us): üòÇüòÇ\n---\nChat Messages From Today:\n[5/7/2025, 1:18:52 PM] Ace Blond (120363418340291229@g.us): Ikv√§ll 18.00 Sam m√∂te üôè\n[5/7/2025, 5:19:48 PM] Ace Blond (120363418340291229@g.us): M√∂tet cancelled\n[5/7/2025, 5:20:08 PM] Ace Blond (120363418340291229@g.us): F√∂r han ligger efter och fastnat i trafik osv ‚Ä¶.\n[5/7/2025, 5:20:51 PM] Ace Blond (120363418340291229@g.us): Men hans brorsa har tydligen jobbat p√• sin sida med tillst√•nd o skit s√• han skulle √•terkommer ikv√§ll om ny tid asap imorgon eller l√∂rdag üôè\n[5/7/2025, 5:31:48 PM] Ace Blond (120363418340291229@g.us): Fredag kl 16.00\n[5/7/2025, 5:33:12 PM] Javid (120363418340291229@g.us): vad √§r deh√§r f√∂r fucking disrespect ass√•\n[5/7/2025, 5:33:21 PM] Javid (120363418340291229@g.us): jag o elias kom ner hela v√§gen hit\n[5/7/2025, 5:33:32 PM] Javid (120363418340291229@g.us): Fuck han o hans bror\n[5/7/2025, 5:33:36 PM] Javid (120363418340291229@g.us): gamling\n[5/7/2025, 5:33:41 PM] Ace Blond (120363418340291229@g.us): Yes\n[5/7/2025, 5:33:51 PM] Ace Blond (120363418340291229@g.us): Licensen √§r v√§ll det √§nda\n[5/7/2025, 5:34:26 PM] Javid (120363418340291229@g.us): Nej\n[5/7/2025, 5:34:31 PM] Javid (120363418340291229@g.us): andra kan fixa\n[5/7/2025, 5:34:34 PM] Ace Blond (120363418340291229@g.us): Sure\n[5/7/2025, 5:34:41 PM] Javid (120363418340291229@g.us): vad h√§nde med han som skulle flytta hit\n[5/7/2025, 5:35:33 PM] Ace Blond (120363418340291229@g.us): Han skulle typ flytta till Valencia eller hit, han √§r f√∂r l√•ngt kort inom en snar framtid\n\n\n--------------------------------\nChat Title: 34632022858@s.whatsapp.net (34632022858@s.whatsapp.net) - 07-05-2025\n\n\n---\nRelevant Context about the contact (THIS IS GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTACT, NOT THE CHAT - USE IT AS CONTEXT FOR THE PERSON BUT DON'T INCLUDE IT IN THE SUMMARY):\nTania is a cleaning service provider who Ace occasionally hires for his rental properties.

She holds a small, yellow, somewhat square-shaped object with a cartoonish face (eyes and mouth visible) in both hands, bringing it towards her mouth. As the object nears her mouth, it emits a bright purple glow from inside and around her mouth area. The background consists of a white brick wall with large, abstract, pastel-colored shapes (yellow and purple) on the left side.\n    *   **0:02 - 0:04:** The girl pulls the yellow object slightly away from her mouth, and the purple glow diminishes and disappears. She opens her mouth as if taking a bite or speaking, still holding the object.\n    *   **0:04 - 0:06:** She brings the yellow object back to her mouth. As it gets close, the purple glow reappears, illuminating her mouth and the object. She smiles and appears to be enjoying the interaction. The video loops back to the beginning.\n\n**Audio Transcription:**\n\n*   The video contains upbeat, playful background music throughout. There is no discernible speech or specific sound effects tied to actions beyond the continuous music. Therefore, a timestamped transcription of specific audio events is not applicable. \n[5/6/2025, 8:58:31 PM] Velislav  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        The image shows a young child with straight black hair, appearing to be smiling or laughing. The child is wearing a light blue, short-sleeved shirt. The child is holding a small, rectangular, blue-and-white object up to their mouth with both hands, seemingly biting onto or playfully pretending to bite the object. The object's design and color suggest it could be a children's product, possibly a toy or a dental-related item like a kids' mouthguard, toothbrush, or oral care device. The background is a plain, soft light blue color, giving the image a clean and modern look. At the bottom of the image, there is a white rounded rectangle button with the text \"SHOP KIDS\" and an arrow pointing to the right, likely indicating that this is a promotional image from an online store targeting children's products. \n[5/6/2025, 8:58:51 PM] Velislav  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        The image shows a young child, possibly a boy, with short, dark hair, wearing a plain white t-shirt. He is holding a bright yellow device with both hands up to his mouth, which is lit up with a noticeable blue glow. The device has a playful, cartoon-like image of an animal face, possibly a bear, on its front, making it look appealing for children. The boy's expression is cheerful or playful, as he engages with the device. The background is a solid light purple color that makes the child and the device stand out clearly. In the lower part of the image, there is an orange button labeled \"CHOOSE OPTIONS\" in white capital letters, along with a right-facing arrow. Beneath the button, the text \"Sonic Pro Kids\" is partially visible followed by more text that seems to be describing a product, indicating this image is likely from a product listing or advertisement for a children's electric toothbrush. \n[5/6/2025, 8:59:03 PM] Velislav  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        The image features a young girl with long, wavy, brown hair, parted on the side. She is smiling widely, showing a gap where a tooth is missing, which makes her expression joyful and playful. The girl is wearing a white dress with light blue vertical stripes on the sleeves and a pleated texture in the center. Her background is a solid, burnt-orange color that makes her and the items she holds stand out prominently.\n\nIn her right hand (on the left side of the image), she is holding a small bottle that appears to be a foaming tooth cleaner or mouthwash, with a yellow label featuring a cheerful cartoon orange or fruit character and a white cap.\n\nIn her left hand (on the right side of the image), she holds a brightly colored yellow object with a cartoonish, smiling orange (or fruit) face on it. The object seems to be a mouthpiece or mouthguard, most likely related to oral hygiene for kids. The mouthpiece is white and shaped to fit over the upper and lower teeth.\n\nBelow the girl, there is a rounded-corner rectangular button with the text ‚ÄúCHOOSE OPTIONS‚Äù in uppercase white letters. To the right of the text, there is a rightward-facing arrow, indicating that it is a clickable button. The button is the same burnt-orange color as the background, allowing it to blend, yet the white text ensures it is visible.\n\nThe overall feel of the image is bright, friendly, and aimed toward child oral hygiene products, with a playful and inviting color scheme and vibe. \n---\nChat Messages From Today:\n[5/7/2025, 8:15:56 PM] Velislav : Yo\n[5/7/2025, 8:15:59 PM] Velislav : Test\n[5/7/2025, 9:01:11 PM] Velislav  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        The image is a formal fashion advertisement for Hugo Boss, a well-known luxury fashion brand.

Centered on the plate is a neatly arranged, thick and fluffy portion of scrambled eggs, shaped almost like a small round cake or mound. The eggs are a rich yellow color and look creamy, with a glossy appearance that suggests they were cooked gently, likely with butter or cream. On top of the scrambled eggs, there is a small garnish consisting of a couple of sprigs of fresh green herbs, possibly microgreens or parsley, adding a hint of color contrast.\n\nTo the left side of the plate, partly visible and resting on the plate, is a fork with a metallic sheen, placed horizontally. In the upper left part of the image, there is a clear glass salt shaker filled with pink Himalayan salt and a blue perforated lid, placed at an angle on the table.\n\nIn the background, to the right and partly out of focus, there is a darker colored plate or tray with some leftover food‚Äîa piece of bread with a white spread or cheese and a green garnish. Also visible is a small wire mesh container holding utensils and possibly napkins, next to a bowl with more food remnants. The wooden table‚Äôs grain is visible, and sunlight is casting shadows, indicating the meal is being enjoyed outdoors or in a well-lit area. The overall presentation is clean and intentional, with attention to food presentation and garnishing. \n[5/7/2025, 9:01:13 PM] Velislav  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        The image shows a close-up view of a person's hand holding a partially eaten wrap. The wrap is tightly rolled and cut in half. Inside the wrap, you can clearly see distinct layers of ingredients, including green lettuce, chunks of grilled chicken, tomato slices, cucumber, and some yellow and orange vegetables, likely bell peppers. There also appears to be some kind of creamy white sauce, possibly mayonnaise or a yogurt-based dressing.\n\nNext to the hand is a metal mesh basket holding sweet potato fries. The fries are upright and presented in a white paper wrapper that is printed with text and illustrations, resembling newspaper. The fries appear golden orange in color and look crispy.\n\nBoth the wrap and fries are served on a round black plate that has grill mark patterns on its surface, likely from where the wrap was toasted. On the plate, there are a couple of stray pieces of vegetables, including a visible red onion slice and a fry.\n\nThe table is a light-colored wood and there is sunlight shining brightly, making the food appear appetizing and casting shadows. In the background, there is a dining table setup visible, including a large knife with a dark handle placed diagonally, a metal pepper shaker, and part of a modern chair with a woven design. The overall scene suggests it‚Äôs an outdoor or well-lit caf√© or restaurant setting. \n[5/7/2025, 9:02:33 PM] Velislav : {\"key\":{\"remoteJid\":\"359884430293@s.whatsapp.net\",\"fromMe\":false,\"id\":\"BCBE59DE84D872F5ACCBC4D3EBA838A9\"},\"messageTimestamp\":1746644553,\"pushName\":\"Velislav\",\"broadcast\":false,\"message\":{\"messageContextInfo\":{\"deviceListMetadata\":{\"senderKeyHash\":\"KdRDE79b6OR1Dw==\",\"senderTimestamp\":\"1746193224\",\"recipientKeyHash\":\"+/42LoNv+eKmYQ==\",\"recipientTimestamp\":\"1746099507\"},\"deviceListMetadataVersion\":2,\"messageSecret\":\"Tpyxu567NXudGGMlGlZ9nr4fJPm9k/9FB7NvlGhfv/o=\"}},\"chatId\":\"359884430293@s.whatsapp.net\",\"timestamp\":{\"_seconds\":1746644553,\"_nanoseconds\":0},\"upsertType\":\"notify\",\"isMedia\":false}\n[5/7/2025, 9:02:34 PM] Velislav  (This imageMessage was converted to text)\n        This image shows a young child standing in a bathroom.
